    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> <span id="current-date"></span></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Chúc Tết</strong> app (herein referred to as the "App") created by <strong>Thoi Nguyen</strong> as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Thoi Nguyen at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
    
    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.</p>
    
    <p>The App does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following services from Google Firebase to improve app stability and analyze usage trends:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> We use this to understand how users interact with the app (e.g., which Tet greetings are most popular, which recipes are viewed) to improve the content. Data is collected anonymously.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> We use this to detect and fix crashes. If the app closes unexpectedly, anonymous logs (including device type, OS version, and stack trace) are sent to us to help fix the bug.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Links to the privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>To provide specific features such as creating greeting cards and saving them, the App requires access to your device's photo library. We are transparent about why we need these permissions:</p>
    
    <h3>iOS Permission: Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description</h3>
    <p>This permission is required for the <strong>"Create New Card"</strong> and <strong>"Edit Template"</strong> features. We access your photo library only when you explicitly choose to upload a personal photo to insert into a Tet greeting card frame.</p>

    <h3>iOS Permission: Privacy - Photo Library Additions Usage Description</h3>
    <p>This permission is required to save your finished greeting cards to your device. When you finish editing a card or choose to download a template, the app needs permission to write this image file to your Camera Roll so you can share it later.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> We do not upload your photos to any private server. The processing of images happens locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>4. App Features and Data</h2>
    <p>The App provides various utility features related to the Lunar New Year (Tet):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sharing Greetings:</strong> When you share an image or copy a text message, this action is handled by your device's native sharing capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Lucky Wheel:</strong> The content you set for the Lucky Wheel is stored locally on your device to remember your preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Tet Information (Taboos, Customs, Recipes):</strong> This content is read-only and does not collect user data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Log Data</h2>
    <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app, I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
